			There are many videos of a girl flaunting an hourglass figure all over Tik-Tok. Not to mention when if you unintentionally spend a few extra seconds on those videos, you will get ten more of them due to algorithm. It is no surprise that the app has been accused of body shaming and unrealistic idealisations. Whether it be seemingly innocent ‘What I Eat in a Day’ videos or body-checking videos, there is a lot of triggering content of eating disorder or negative self-image to be seen on the app. This can be a serious negative effect for youngsters and especially for those whose have been struggling.<br>Besides, the privacy concerns of the app has always been an issue. Many politicians believe that China could use Tik-Tok to spy on users or mine their data, which poses a risk to national security. While censorship, massive surveillance and even abuse of human right has been a concerns for the Chinese government, the anxiety of the possible threat of user safety and security still remains.
